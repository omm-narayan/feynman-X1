## Feynman X1

> **An AI-driven, seven-axis robotic arm for laboratory automation.**

Feynman X1 is not an industrial robot adapted for labs — it is **lab-native**.
Built to automate repetitive scientific workflows, it learns directly from protocol data and executes with precision, flexibility, and ease.

No heavy integration. No complex programming.
Just an intelligent, affordable, and seamless **robotic lab technician**.

### Key Ideas

* **Seven-axis dexterity** for complex lab tasks.
* **AI autonomy** over rigid pre-programming.
* **Accessible design**: plug, play, and scale.

---

### Vision

X1 is the first step toward a **modular humanoid robotics ecosystem** — where arms become assistants, and labs interact with robots as naturally as with colleagues.
